ideas for viri
MAJOR:
- docs
- check evasions
- deeper conthists
- big tuning run (check that the UCI tune parameters actually make it in to the engine!!)
- support chess variants
-- FRC
-- DFRC
-- Crazyhouse

MINOR:
- replace all the false/true constgen stuff with a proper type.
- fullwindow on big scores (+30?)
- remove `as` casts and unsafe code FOR REAL
- try to reduce attr use, it's ugly.
- make FEN conversion not halt singlethreaded when writing to file. or generally.
- the slow part of deduplication is the file I/O, consider mmap?.
- multipv. put the moves in ThreadData and use ROOT.
- Rust features to watch for: full const generics, const floating-point maths.
- make the big-piece and other stuff better named
- filter training positions that are forced.
-- datagen, data reanalysis, maybe other things
- add Shuffle Chess starting positions for datagen. (double shuffle chess?)
- cool Stash-style time management
- validate this FEN properly: "r3qrk1/pppb1pbp/3p1np1/3P2B1/2PpP3/2N2PP1/PP1Q3P/R3KB1R w kq - 0 4"
- move lookup functions into being associated functions of Piece/PieceType/Colour/Move and so on.
- self.skip_quiets && not_winning should exit straight to None, rather than wasting time.
- embed magics
- clean up magic gen code
- SquareSet type
- clean movegen more generally
- book construction?
