ideas for viri
MAJOR:
- docs
- lazy NNUE updates
- eval caching
- train with gradual LR drop
-- Crazyhouse

MINOR:
- Rust features to watch for: full const generics, const floating-point maths.
- make the big-piece and other stuff better named
- filter training positions that are forced.
-- datagen, data reanalysis, maybe other things
- validate this FEN properly: "r3qrk1/pppb1pbp/3p1np1/3P2B1/2PpP3/2N2PP1/PP1Q3P/R3KB1R w kq - 0 4"
- move lookup functions into being associated functions of Piece/PieceType/Colour/Move and so on.
- embed magics
- clean up magic gen code
- add module docs
- right-align seldepth in pretty UCI output
